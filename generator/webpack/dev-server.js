  // WebpackDevServer 2.4.3 introduced a security fix that prevents remote
  // websites from potentially accessing local content through DNS rebinding:
  // https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887
  // https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a
  // However, it made several existing use cases such as development in cloud
  // environment or subdomains in development significantly more complicated:
  // https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2271
  // https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2233
  // While we're investigating better solutions, for now we will take a
  // compromise. Since our WDS configuration only serves files in the `public`
  // folder we won't consider accessing them a vulnerability. However, if you
  // use the `proxy` feature, it gets more dangerous because it can expose
  // remote code execution vulnerabilities in backends like Django and Rails.
  // So we will disable the host check normally, but enable it if you have
  // specified the `proxy` setting. Finally, we let you override it if you
  // really know what you're doing with a special environment variable.
  // Note: ["localhost", ".localhost"] will support subdomains - but we might
  // want to allow setting the allowedHosts manually for more complex setups

    // This is confusing because those files wonâ€™t automatically be available in

    // project directory is dangerous because we may expose sensitive files.
    // Instead, we establish a convention that only files in `public` directory
    // get served. Our build script will copy `public` into the `build` folder.
    // In `index.html`, you can get URL of `public` folder with %DEFAULT_SEGMENT%:
    // <link rel="icon" href="%DEFAULT_SEGMENT%/favicon.ico">

    // for files like `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, and libraries that are
    // for some reason broken when imported through webpack. If you just want to
